* Createvm was designed to create virtual machines from the command line interface (or called by a script)
*
* My copy assumes that you have an SSD drive, and a primary datastore, datastore1 which you will be installing to. 
* If your setup does not match this, you will need to be sure to edit this configuration to include your datastores.
*
* If you have any questions, feel free to leave questions on my github or email me at
